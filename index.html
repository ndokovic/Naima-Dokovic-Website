        <p class="lead mb-4">Naima Dokovic comes from Corona, California where she was born and raised her whole life. She graduated from Norco High School as an AP Scholar and with Honors with Distinction. Naima established the "Green Club" at her school which sparked the interest she had for the environment. As the president, she put together tons of cleanups, improved the schools recycling system, and continuously informed her community about the enironment, all in attempt to decrease societies carbon footprint. As she always enjoyed educating others and making a difference in people's lives, she now continues her educational journey at the University of California Riverside in hopes of becoming an environmental science teacher and fullfil her desire to spread awareness to the world and make a change.<br><br>
          Teachers have always been her role model because they dedicate their time to helping students and giving them all the supplies they need to succeed. Everyone always looks at the doctor's who save lives, however teacher's are life savers as well because she would not be here without them, and that goes for all other students as well. In high school Naima had one teacher in particular who she could go to with any of her problems, whether they were school related or not, and her teacher would take time out of her day to make sure she was feeling better about whatever was bothering her. This one teacher made her high school experience that much better and still continues to help her throughout college with the words that stuck with her. These are the stories and experiences that Naima wants to be able to have on someone one day. She wants to help and contribute to the change of the world that is extremely necessary in more ways than one. The way a single person can have such an effect on others or the world is incredible and she thinks not enough people believe that they can make a difference. This is a problem she hopes to fix being a teacher, one student at a time. <br><br> 
        As she begins volunteering at her old elementary school, Washington, everyday she is there just confirms her passion for this field of work. Seeing the smiles on the students faces when they finally grasp the information, is a reward within itself. Those are the reasons she choose her particular path.
